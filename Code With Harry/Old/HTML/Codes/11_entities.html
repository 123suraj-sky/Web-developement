    <!-- 
    1) html ignores extra spaces
    to get more spaces we use entities
    entities used to display reserved characters in html
    also used to write special characters
    or symbols not present on keyboard
    2) we use "&nbsp;", it means non breakable space
    3) if we want to show a tag like 10 line above
    for that we write &lt;p&gt;
     -->
