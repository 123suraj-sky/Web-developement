<body>
    <p style="border: 2px solid red;">this is a paragraph</p>
    <p style="border: 2px solid blue;">this is also a paragraph</p>

    <span style="border: 2px solid red;">this is a span</span>
    <span style="border: 2px solid red;">this is also a span</span>


    <!--
    1) "paragraph", "div", "li",...are block element
    i.e. it takes whole block
    2) "span", "strong", "a", "em",...are inline element
    i.e. it takes whole that space equal to its text size
    'a' is anchor
    3) use 'style = "border"' for border of element,
    we will learn in detail about it in CSS
    but it is not recommended
